We use this tool also based on your approval (art. 6 para. 1, p. 1 lit. a GDPR). We use the Facebook pixel to be able to show you personalized advertising on Facebook and to analyze your user behavior on our website. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. To do this, simply use one of the listed opt-out options.</p>
                                <p class="about">If you connect to our website, then the Facebook pixel is triggered when connected to our website and one of our cookies, which collects the recorded data, is placed on your terminal (so-called first party cookie). In addition, Facebook as well as other companies directly place cookies (so-called third party cookies). Web beacons and other storage technologies may also be used. This means that a so-called cookie is placed on your terminal.</p>

By using the Facebook pixel we can, for example, identify whether you were transferred to our website after the click on the Facebook ad and how you integrated with our website (so-called “conversion”). By using the Facebook pixel, we can specify you and additional visitors of our website as a target group for Facebook ads. Therefore, we are using the Facebook pixel to achieve a better customer approach on Facebook. Because the Facebook ads that are placed by us will only be transferred to those Facebook users who have shown an interest in our offerings or who show certain characteristics (e.g. interest in certain subjects or products, which are determined based on the visited websites, so-called "custom audiences through website"). We also want to ensure that our Facebook ads are in accordance with your interests and that they do not bother you.</p>
